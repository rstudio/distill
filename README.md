Distill for R Markdown is a web publishing format optimized for
scientific and technical communication. Distill articles include:

- Reader-friendly typography that adapts well to mobile devices.
- Features essential to technical writing like LaTeX math, citations,
  and footnotes.
- Flexible figure layout options (e.g. displaying figures at a larger
  width than the article text).
- Attractively rendered tables with optional support for pagination.
- Support for a wide variety of diagramming tools for illustrating
  concepts.
- The ability to incorporate JavaScript and D3-based interactive
  visualizations.
- A variety of ways to publish articles, including support for
  publishing collections or articles as a Distill website.

Distill for R Markdown is based on the [Distill web
framework](https://github.com/distillpub/template), which was originally
created for use in the Distill Machine Learning Journal. Distill for R
Markdown combines the technical authoring features of Distill with [R
Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), enabling a fully reproducible
workflow based on literate programming.
