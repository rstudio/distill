Distill for R Markdown is a web publishing format optimized for
scientific and technical communication. Distill articles include:

  - Reader-friendly typography that adapts well to mobile devices.
  - Features essential to technical writing like LaTeX math, citations,
    and footnotes.
  - Flexible figure layout options (e.g. displaying figures at a larger
    width than the article text).
  - Attractively rendered tables with optional support for pagination.
  - Support for a wide variety of diagramming tools for illustrating
    concepts.
  - The ability to incorporate JavaScript and D3-based interactive
    visualizations.
  - A variety of ways to publish articles, including support for
    publishing collections or articles as a Distill website.

Distill for R Markdown is based on the [Distill web
framework](https://github.com/distillpub/template), which was originally
created for use in the Distill Machine Learning Journal. Distill for R
Markdown combines the technical authoring features of Distill with [R
Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), enabling a fully reproducible
workflow based on literate programming.
