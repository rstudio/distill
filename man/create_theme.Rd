\details{
How do you apply a custom theme to a Distill site or blog? You have two
options:
\enumerate{
\item Apply it site-wide by adding a \code{theme} key to the top-level of your
\verb{_site.yml} configuration file:\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode yaml">}}\preformatted{name: "distill"
title: "Distill for R Markdown"
theme: theme.css
navbar:
  # (navbar definition here)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
\item Apply to an individual article by adding a \code{theme} key to your
article’s YAML front-matter:\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode yaml">}}\preformatted{---
title: "The Sharpe Ratio"
output:
  distill::distill_article:
    toc: true
    theme: theme.css
---
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}

The second option allows for you to apply your theme to individual
articles, while using a different theme for the rest of your site. Note
that this is only possible for stand-alone articles within a website —
you cannot apply a theme to individual blog posts \emph{only}.
